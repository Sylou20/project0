# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project0 is a personal webpage about me. So you will find a cover picture and a profile picture (which is mobile-responsive). The website is structured in 4 parts (in a navigation bar):
- 1. A summary about me (presented in a unordered list)
- 2. Illustrations of my friends (presented in a Bootstrap's grid model)
- 3. A list of my interests (presented in a table)
- 4. A page to let me a comment.
